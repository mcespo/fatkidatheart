A basic and balanced crepe recipe that can be modidified as needed.

## Ingredients

| Item                           | Amount           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| eggs                           | 100 g (x 2 eggs) |
| sugar                          | 12%g (1 tbsp)    |
| sea salt                       | 5 g (1 tsp)      |
| all-purpose or pasty flour     | 94g (¾ cup)      |
| milk                           | 120ml (½ cup)    |
| unsalted butter (to be melted) | 42g (⅓ cup)      |

## Tools

| Items                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| Cast iron, or any wide pan                      |
| Scale                                           |
| Stove                                           |
| Whisk or item to mix with                       |
| Ladle or large spoon to pour with               |
| Rag, or oven mit as the pan might get quite hot |
| Spatula or thin flat spoon for flipping crepes  |

## Recipe

1. If using cast iron pan, heat on stovetop while you gather ingredients. If using any other pan, consider heating the pan after you have your items.

2. In a large bowl, crack eggs, add sugar and salt and begin scrambling until well combined.

3. While continuing to mix, add flour and slowly incorporate milk (the flour will dry up the mixture and we want a batter, not a dough).

4. Add unsalted butter to your pan. Once melted, pour into the bowl and continue mixing (the excess butter still on the pan can be used to make your first crepe).

5. If the batter looks a little too rich, this is the moment we will incorporate water. You do not need to use the full amount, and can generally eye this amount as needed.

::: tip
This part is subjective. You will only learn it through practice but you are looking for a batter easy enough to ladle but not as rich as a heavy cream but not as thin as milk. Add water only if the batter seems too thick.

6. Ladle enough of the batter to just barely cover the pan. You should be able to pour onto one edge and allow swirling the pan to do most of the work. The fisr crepe may fail, but as you continue, you will develop a feel for this.

7. The crepe will set on one side after one minute or so. If you peek under the cooked side and notice browning, the crepe is ready to flip. Once fliped, you should only need to cook for about 30 seconds or half the time as the original side.
