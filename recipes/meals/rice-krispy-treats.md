# Rice Krispy Treats

## Description

This is a 70% cereal to mallow ratio. I tend to prefer this type of softness for my treats but you can always play around. For the maths: `(cereal / marshmallows) * 100 = 70%`. The logic behind the `141g` of marshmallows is the full bag of Jet-Puffed Mini Marshmallows mini is `283g`. If we divide that bag by two it should land us at `141.5g`. You can make the full bag of marshmallows if you have about four adults sharing - not to suggest you cant eat the whole thing yourself. You do you.

If you want to play with ratios (like a 60% cereal to mallow ratio), you just need to do some percentage work: `marshmallows * 0.60 = cereal amount`.


## Ingredients

| Item | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| marshmallows | 141g |
| rice cereal | 99g |
| butter | 1tbsp |
| sea salt | pinch |
| cooking spray |  |

## Tools

| Items |
| --- |
| Pot |
| Scale |
| Stove |
| rubber spatula or device to mix with |
| Parchment paper |
| small rimmed baking sheet or other type of rectangular tray |

## Recipe

1. Season a glass baking sheet or tray with cooking spray (we will add the finished treats to this container).
2. Measure out marshmallows and cereal (you can also heat up butter and scale directly onto the same pot so long as you are being safe about the hot pot and scale).
3. In a large pot, melt the butter, along with pinch of salt.
4. Add marshmallows to pot and mix around until most of them have melted.
5. Add the cereal and immediately turn off heat (continuing the heat will result in the treats stiffening once they reach room temp).
6. Fold the cereal gently until most of the marshmallows have incorporated into the cereal.
7. Transfer the cereal mix into the baking sheet or tray. Press and spread from edge to edge.
8. Use parchment paper to press down onto the cereal to evenly spread.
9. Eat.
