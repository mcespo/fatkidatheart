## Recipe

1. Mix all dry ingedients in large mixing bowl.

2. Mix water and milk and warm to 100degrees.

3. add oil to the warm milk, and pour into the dry

3. Mix with a fork to try and incorporate the two. This is the autolyze phase so just loosly mix and let sit for 15 minutes.

4. After the 15 minutes, the flour should be hydrated enough that now folding should be slightly less work. Fold and press until you can create a decent ball of dough. Let dough sit for 30-60 minutues.

5. split dough into portions. make balls out of those portions (I dont recall if its six or so portions or not so I dont have good notes)

6. more to come at later day...
